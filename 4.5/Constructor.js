They should be executed only with "new" operator.

Usually, constructors do not have a return statement. Their task is to write all necessary stuff into this, and it automatically becomes the result.

But if there is a return statement, then the rule is simple:

If return is called with an object, then the object is returned instead of this.
If return is called with a primitive, itâ€™s ignored.
