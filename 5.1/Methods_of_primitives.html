        A primitive
        Is a value of a primitive type.
        There are 7 primitive types: string, number, bigint, boolean, symbol, null and undefined.

        /*
        An object
        Is capable of storing multiple values as properties.
        Can be created with {}, for instance: {name: "John", age: 30}. There are other kinds of objects in JavaScript: functions, for example, are objects.
